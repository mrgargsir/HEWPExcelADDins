To auto-solve the captcha using OCR, you can use the `pytesseract` library along with `Pillow`. Here’s how you can update your `Captcha_Solver` function to use OCR and automatically fill the captcha:

**1. Install dependencies (if not already):**
```sh
pip install pytesseract pillow requests
```
Also, [install Tesseract-OCR for Windows](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc) and add its path to your system environment variables.

[https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases)

To install **Tesseract-OCR** on Windows:

1. **Download the installer:**  
   Go to the official repo:  
   [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases)  
   Download the latest `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-*.exe` file.

2. **Run the installer:**  
   Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the installation steps.  
   Note the install path (default is usually `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).

3. **(Optional but recommended) Add Tesseract to your PATH:**  
   - Open Windows Search, type `environment variables`, and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
   - Click **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System variables**, find and select `Path`, then click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add:  
     `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`
   - Click OK to save.

4. **Verify installation:**  
   Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```
   tesseract --version
   ```
   You should see the version info.

5. **Python usage:**  
   If Tesseract is not in your PATH, set the path in your code:
   ```python
   import pytesseract
   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
   ```

You’re now ready to use OCR in your Python scripts!
